# Boolean-Model_Inverted-Index

It is an implementation of Boolean Model using Inverted Index in java.
The stopWords List and Short Stories(1-50[txts]) are given.
We have to extract the words from Short Stories and make a Inverted Index.
Then using the Stopwords.txt file we need to remove these stop-words from the 
inverted index.
Finally we need to create Boolean Query Method to let user input a boolean query 
and get the no. of documents and document numbers in which given words are present.
